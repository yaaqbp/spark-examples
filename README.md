# spark-examples

Some examples of using SparkTorch and SparkNLP on cluster.

Cluster specification (HDFS and Spark)
1x master
2x worker 

working on RHEL9

In "master-examples" there are few notebooks with similar code with NLP tasks to do only on one server. I was trying to compare time and resources needed for that tasks.
